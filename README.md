NOTE: at this point of development this bot is suitable only for experienced users. Some of the documentation below may be deprecated or otherwise lacking.

# tunnelerjs
A lightweight moderator bot with anti spam capabilities.
Can be used as a simple anti spam bot without any extra features.

Do note: source code above is work in progress for the next build. See releases if you'd 
like to download a working copy.

## Installation Requirements
1) [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 6 or higher installed.

2) NPM (should come with the Node).

3) Registered [Discord application](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me/). Must be registered as a client.

## Installation
1) See releases and download the newest version. Extract the package.

2) Create `auth.json` file into `<extracted package>/config` dir. On windows, make sure your file extensions are not hidden (default), otherwise you'll end up having e.g. `auth.json.txt` instead of `auth.json`.

3) Input your [application](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me/) credentials into the `auth.json` file. See the syntax below.

```
{
  "token": "Your app's token.",
  "id": "Your app's client id.",
  "owner": "Your own discord id."
}
```

4) With a command prompt or such, navigate to the project folder. E.g. on windows: `cd c:/git/tunnelerjs`. Make sure the path becomes active. If your drive letter is something else than c, try inputting the letter after the cd-command: `c:`.

5) Enter `npm install`. This will download all the required 3rd party components, like Discord.js.

6) From now on you can start the bot with a `node tunneler` command. Remember, you can also create a .bat file for the startup process.

7) Invite the bot to your servers via a regular web browser. Use the following url: `https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=YOUR_APP_CLIENT_ID_HERE&scope=bot&permissions=0 `. Replace `YOUR_APP_CLIENT_ID_HERE` with the application id of the bot.

## Custom commands (optional)
You can also script your own custom commands. Here's how you can integrate them with the bot:

1) Add your script into `/commands` dir. Please see the correct syntax from the other command files.

2) Add your command into command mapping `/config/commands.json`. The key is the command word inputted by a client, the value is the actual mapped command script. For example `module.inc.about` turns into `about`. You can have multiple command words for a single command script.

3) Register your command in `tunneler.js`, `const commands`. There should be sufficient amount of examples present.

4) Reboot the bot and you are done.
